# collegeCourseworkProject
A game I made as my A-level computer science coursework project in 2021. Documentation included.

While there are a variety of mechanics in the game that I would like to improve on,
I am proud of this work having finished it at sixth form college during covid-19, when times weren't so easy.
This project gave me a lot of exciting and challenging moments, all of which really ignited my passion for making video games
(and a greater appreciation for game developers!) and programming in general.

Where I have sourced code in the project, I have included a reference(s) in the documentation.

All code for the project can be found at the end of the documentation.
