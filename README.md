# My College Coursework Project
A game I made as my A-level computer science coursework project in 2021. Documentation included. Written in C#, for the Unity Game Engine.

The core premise of the game is to beat 5 levels randomly selected, where each level is either Action, Horror, Puzzle, or Platformer-based. Levels get harder as you progress.

Where I have sourced code in the project, I have included a reference(s) in the documentation.

All code for the project can be found at the end of the documentation.
